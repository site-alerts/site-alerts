Proactive dashboard alerts and actionable insights for your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Proactive Site Advisor monitors key site signals and displays clear, actionable alerts directly inside your WordPress admin dashboard.

Instead of simply reporting raw numbers, the plugin detects unusual patterns and highlights them with short explanations and suggested checks.

Examples of monitored signals include:

- Sudden drops in site activity
- Unexpected spikes in activity
- Increased 404 (Not Found) requests

When unusual behavior is detected, administrators see a concise alert with context to help them investigate potential causes.

All monitoring runs locally within your WordPress installation.
No external APIs are required and no data is sent to third parties.

Key features:

- Automatic detection of unusual activity patterns
- Admin dashboard alerts with brief explanations
- Suggested checks to help investigate issues
- Lightweight and performance-conscious implementation
- No external services or tracking

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `proactive-site-advisor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Alerts will automatically appear in the admin dashboard when unusual activity is detected.
